  <h1>Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried?</h1>
  <p>What are their names? Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. You can see how I lived before I met you. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Really?!</p>
  <p><strong>Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</strong> <em> In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up!</em> Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.</p>
  <h2>I suppose I could part with 'one' and still be feared…</h2>
  <p>No, of course not. It was… uh… porno. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, I do that with my stupidness. Nay, I respect and admire Harold Zoid too much to beat him to death with his own Oscar. No! The kind with looting and maybe starting a few fires!</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography.</li><li>There's no part of that sentence I didn't like!</li>
    <li>Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers?</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Large bet on myself in round one.</h3>
  <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! Um, is this the boring, peaceful kind of taking to the streets? We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! And so we say goodbye to our beloved pet, Nibbler, who's gone to a place where I, too, hope one day to go. The toilet.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Are you crazy? I can't swallow that.</li>
    <li>That's a popular name today. Little "e", big "B"?</li>
    <li>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. But, okay! I don't want to be rescued. Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
  <p>Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose. Leela's gonna kill me. She also liked to shut up! Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.</p>
  <p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! And when we woke up, we had these bodies. A sexy mistake. It must be wonderful. Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</p>
  <p>I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. They're like sex, except I'm having them!</p>
  <p>So, how 'bout them Knicks? Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Bite my shiny metal ass. I didn't ask for a completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! I usually try to keep my sadness pent up inside where it can fester quietly as a mental illness.</p>
  <p>I am the man with no name, Zapp Brannigan! I don't want to be rescued. That could be 'my' beautiful soul sitting naked on a couch. If I could just learn to play this stupid thing. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
  <p>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Why not indeed! Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. Tell her she looks thin.</p>
  <h2>Shinier than yours, meatbag.</h2>
  <p>Oh yeah, good luck with that. These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. Shut up and take my money! Ooh, name it after me! Yes, I saw. You were doing well, until everyone died.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</li>
    <li>Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!</li>
    <li>Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Oh right. I forgot about the battle.</h3>
  <p>Oh, I don't have time for this. I have to go and buy a single piece of fruit with a coupon and then return it, making people wait behind me while I complain. Pansy. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!</li>
    <li>It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.</li>
    <li>Oh no! The professor will hit me! But if Zoidberg 'fixes' it… then perhaps gifts!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors! I had more, but you go ahead. This is the worst part. The calm before the battle. And until then, I can never die?</p>
  <p>Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Why not indeed! Kids have names? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit!</p>
  <p>Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</p>
  <p>I've been there. My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants. What am I, the pope? Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. I love you, buddy! But I've never been to the moon! You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing.</p>
  <p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Bender?! You stole the atom. Oh yeah, good luck with that. Actually, that's still true.</p>
  <p>No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! No, she'll probably make me do it. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! Who are you, my warranty?!</p>
  <p>Shut up and take my money! Oh God, what have I done? Bender, you risked your life to save me! My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards.</p>
  <p>It must be wonderful. Negative, bossy meat creature! The alien mothership is in orbit here. <strong> If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards.</strong> <em> Checkmate.</em> Why not indeed!</p>
  <h2>I was having the most wonderful dream. Except you were there, and you were there, and you were there!</h2>
  <p>Eeeee! Now say "nuclear wessels"! Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. What are their names? I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! Why am I sticky and naked? Did I miss something fun?</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Is that a cooking show?</li>
    <li>I was all of history's great robot actors - Acting Unit 0.8; Thespomat; David Duchovny!</li>
    <li>Why did you bring us here?</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!</h3>
  <p>Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. Who am I making this out to? Soon enough. You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! That's not soon enough!</p>
  <ul>
    li>Anyone who laughs is a communist!</li>
    <li>Oh God, what have I done?</li>
    <li>Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like I just went ten rounds with mighty Thor. Bender, we're trying our best. You guys realize you live in a sewer, right? It must be wonderful. Ummm…to eBay?</p>
  <p>Of all the friends I've had… you're the first. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. And from now on you're all named Bender Jr.</p>
  <p>Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. Well, thanks to the Internet, I'm now bored with sex. Is there a place on the web that panders to my lust for violence? Tell her you just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating.</p>
  <p>It may comfort you to know that Fry's death took only fifteen seconds, yet the pain was so intense, that it felt to him like fifteen years. And it goes without saying, it caused him to empty his bowels. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>
